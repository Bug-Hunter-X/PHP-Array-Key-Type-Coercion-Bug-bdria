In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly strings or integers.  Consider this example:

```php
$data = [];
$data[true] = 'This is true';
$data[false] = 'This is false';
$data[1] = 'This is one';

var_dump($data);
```

You might expect `$data` to have three elements. However, the output reveals:

```
array(2) {
  [1]=>
  string(11) "This is one"
  [""]=>
  string(12) "This is false"
}
```

Notice that `true` is cast to `1`, thus overriding the value associated with the key 1. `false` is cast to an empty string. This unexpected behavior can lead to data loss or inconsistencies.  It's crucial to use consistent and explicit string keys, or be very mindful of PHP's type coercion when using numeric or boolean keys.
